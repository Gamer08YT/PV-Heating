### Working Principle

```
CURRENT_POWER = METER(IMPORT - EXPORT)

IF CURRENT_POWER >= (OFFSET + MIN_POWER)
    SET POWER TO CURRENT_POWER - OFFSET
ELSE
    SET POWER TO 0
END
```

Examples:
```
CURRENT_POWER = -1000W (Exporting)
OFFSET = 100W
MIN_POWER = 300W

POWER = 900W
```

OR

```
CURRENT_POWER = -300W (Exporting)
OFFSET = 100W
MIN_POWER = 300W

POWER = 0W
```

### Calibration
